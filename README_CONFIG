Configuration file format for jmatconvol and fmatconvol
-------------------------------------------------------


See the files in the directory 'config-files' for some
examples. Lines starting with '#' are comments.


The following commands are available:


/convolver/new  <inputs> <outputs> <maximum impulse length> <number of threads>

    This command is always required and must be first one.

    The 'maximum impulse length' has an impact on the amount of memory
    used and on the CPU load. Do not use a larger value than necessary.
    It is limited to 4096 samples in this release.
    
    The compution load can be more or less equally distributed over
    a configurable number of parallel threads. This value should
    normally be equal to the number of available CPUs.


/input/name <input number> <port name> {<source port>}
/output/name <output number> <port name> {<destination port>}

    These can be used to provide more informative ports names,
    and to optionally connect the inputs or outputs. Input and
    output numbers start at 1. These command are ignored by
    fmatconvol.  


/input/gain <input number> <linear gain>
/input/dbgain <input number> <gainin dB>
/output/gain <output number> <linear gain>
/output/dbgain <output number> <gainin dB>

    These can be used to apply an additional gain factor
    to each input or output.


/cd <path>

    Change the directory where impulse response files are searched
    for to 'path'. Permits the use of short names in the commands
    below. Initial value is the current directory.


/matrix/load  <gain> <file>

    Load the entire convolution matrix from an audio file.
    If 'ninp' and 'nout' are the matrix dimensions, the file
    must have 'ninp' channels, and the file size in frames
    must be an exact multiple of 'nout'. The file will be
    read as 'nout' equal lenght sections, one for each output.
    The 'gain' parameter is a linear gain factor.


/matrix/load_transp  <gain> <file>

    Load the entire convolution matrix from an audio file.
    If 'ninp' and 'nout' are the matrix dimensions, the file
    must have 'nout' channels, and the file size in frames
    must be an exact multiple of 'ninp'. The file will be
    read as 'ninp' equal lenght sections, one for each input.
    The 'gain' parameter is a linear gain factor.


/matrix/load_output <output> <gain> <file>

    Load the all impulses for a single output from an audio file.
    The file  must have 'ninp' channels. Output numbers start at 1.
    The 'gain' parameter is a linear gain factor.


/matrix/load_input <input> <gain> <file>

    Load the all impulses for a single input from an audio file.
    The file  must have 'nout' channels. Input numbers start at 1.
    The 'gain' parameter is a linear gain factor.
